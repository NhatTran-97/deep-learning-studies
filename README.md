# Deep Learning Theory

This repository contains practical implementations of core deep learning theory concepts.  
The code is based on my learning journey through various online courses, including:

- [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [AIVN (AI Vietnam)](https://aivietnam.edu.vn/)
- [ProtonX by Coursemind](https://protonx.coursemind.io/courses)

The goal of this repository is to consolidate theoretical knowledge into hands-on code examples, covering topics such as:

- Math fundamentals for deep learning
- Machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression
- Neural network architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM)
- Optimization techniques and loss functions
- And more...
